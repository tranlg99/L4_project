# Plan

* 3D particle-based video prediction
* Linda Tran
* 2472123T
* Paul Henderson

Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

__Main objectives:__ implement PIPs model in Colab, test on different and longer datasets, implement a prediction model for future frames, evaluate the model

* **Week 1**
  * Project bidding
* **Week 2**
  * Initial meeting with supervisor
  * Setting up VCS, reference manager
  * Research
* **Week 3**
  * Implementing PIPs model in Colab and see if it works on some of their videos
  * Further reserach
* **Week 4**
  * Figure out how to run the model on longer dataset, driving dataset
* **Week 5**
  * Look into neural networks, segmentation/optical flow
* **Week 6**
  
* **Week 7**
  * Adapt existing model to predict next frames' position of targets
* **Week 8**

* **Week 9**
  * Rebuild the future frames pixels from the predicted position of targets
* **Week 10**
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]**
  * Evaluate the prediction model
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.
