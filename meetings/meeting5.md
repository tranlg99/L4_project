## Notes ##
### Work done last week
* investigated the performance of PIP on different videos, and chose a dataset
* downloaded videos from the Tai chi category of YouTube 8M dataset
* continued research in DL: Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformers



### Questions


1. __Question 1__

  * Answer


2. __Question 2__ 

  * Answer

## Plan ##
* Create sequences of frames from the videos
* Create a pipeline that parses data and stores the outputs which will be used to train the deep neural network (NumPy files of pairs of rgb frame and coordinates tensor)
* Continue research into DL: segmentation modesl, CNN classifiers
