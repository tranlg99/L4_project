## Notes ##
### Work done last week
* pipeline for creating training data finished
* research into semantic segmentation models

Splitting and sticking back traj points together doesn't give the same results as not splitting the point grid. The mean of difference (not_split_grid - split_grid) is -0.0065164566 and median -0.0065164566. This error is hopefully small enough.
